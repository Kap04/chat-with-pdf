# Chat-with-PDF

**Live Demo:** https://chat-with-pdf-usai.vercel.app/

A Next.js + TypeScript application that lets users interact with their PDF documents using AI. Upload a PDF, convert it to embeddings for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and chat with the content seamlessly.

## 🚀 Features

- **PDF Upload & Parsing:** Drag-and-drop or select PDFs for processing.  
- **Embeddings & VectorDB:** Convert document text into embeddings and store in a vector database.  
- **AI Chat Interface:** Ask questions, get context-aware answers powered by RAG.  
- **Stripe Integration:** Secure payment flow for premium usage tiers.  
- **Hosted & Scalable:** Deployed on Vercel for fast, reliable performance.

## 📐 Architecture

1. **Upload:** User uploads PDF → server parses text pages.  
2. **Embeddings:** Text chunks sent to OpenAI for embeddings → stored in VectorDB.  
3. **Query:** User chat prompts → retrieves relevant vectors → generates AI response.  
4. **Payment:** Stripe checkout for access control and usage tracking.
